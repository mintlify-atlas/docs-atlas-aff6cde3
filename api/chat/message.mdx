## Overview

This is the primary endpoint for interacting with Reze AI Agent. The agent will understand your request naturally, ask clarifying questions if needed, and call appropriate tools (like sending emails or checking status) based on the conversation context.

The endpoint streams responses in real-time using FastAPI's native streaming capabilities.

## Response

Returns a `StreamingResponse` with `text/plain` content type. The response streams text chunks in real-time as the agent processes your message.

### Response headers

<ResponseField name="X-Conversation-ID" type="string">
  The conversation ID for this session. Use this ID to continue the conversation or retrieve history.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Cache-Control" type="string">
  Set to `no-cache` to prevent caching of streaming responses.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="X-Accel-Buffering" type="string">
  Set to `no` to disable buffering for streaming responses.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Content-Type" type="string">
  Set to `text/plain` for streaming text content.
</ResponseField>

### Response body

The response body is a stream of text chunks. Each chunk is a portion of the agent's response, delivered in real-time as the agent generates it.

## Example conversation flow

```
You: "Send an email to john@example.com"
Reze: "Sure! What should the subject be?"
You: "Welcome email"
Reze: "Got it. What should the email say?"
You: "Just a simple welcome message"
Reze: [Uses send_email tool] "Email sent! ID: abc123"
```

## Error handling

If an error occurs during streaming, an error message will be appended to the stream in the format:

```
[Error: error message here]
```

The endpoint returns a 500 status code for server errors.
