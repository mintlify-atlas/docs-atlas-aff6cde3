description: Get the delivery status of a sent email using the PydanticAI tool

## Overview

The `get_email_status` tool retrieves the delivery status of an email sent through Resend.com. This tool should always be called when a user asks about email status.

## Parameters

<ParamField path="email_id" type="string" required>
  The unique email ID from Resend. This can come from:
  - User provides it directly (most common)
  - From a previous `send_email` operation in this conversation
  - From conversation context/memory
</ParamField>

## Return value

<ResponseField name="result" type="string">
  A formatted string containing the email status information, or error message if the operation fails.
  
  The response includes:
  - Email ID and current status
  - Creation timestamp
  - Last event (if available)
  - Status-specific message explaining the current state
  
  **Possible statuses:**
  - `queued`: The email is queued and will be sent shortly
  - `sent`: The email has been sent to the recipient's mail server
  - `delivered`: The email has been successfully delivered to the recipient
  - `bounced`: The email bounced - the recipient's mail server rejected it
  - `complained`: The recipient marked the email as spam
</ResponseField>

## Usage guidelines

**Always call this tool when:**
- User asks about email status
- Even if they provide the email_id directly

## Example

```python
data = GetEmailStatusRequest(email_id="abc123def456")

result = await get_email_status(ctx, data)
# Returns formatted status information:
# "Email abc123def456 status: DELIVERED
# - Created: 2024-01-15 10:30:00
# - Last event: delivered
# ✓ The email has been successfully delivered to the recipient."
```

## Error handling

If the email ID is invalid or not found, returns:
```
✗ Failed to retrieve email status: {error}. Please verify the email ID.
```
