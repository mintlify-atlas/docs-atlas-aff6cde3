## What is Reze?

Reze is a chat-only AI agent that brings natural language capabilities to your email operations. Built on top of Resend.com's powerful email infrastructure, Reze lets you send emails, track delivery status, and get instant answers about email features through simple conversations.

Powered by GLM 4.7 from z.ai and enhanced with Memvid RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), Reze understands your intent and executes email operations while maintaining full conversation context across multiple turns.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="User sends a message">
    You send a natural language message through the chat interface or API, like "Send a welcome email to john@example.com"
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI understands intent">
    GLM 4.7 processes your message and determines the appropriate action. If information is missing, Reze asks clarifying questions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="RAG enhances context">
    Memvid searches the Resend documentation to provide accurate, up-to-date information for your query.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Action is executed">
    Reze calls the appropriate Resend API endpoint and executes the operation (send email, check status, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Streaming response">
    You receive a real-time streaming response with detailed feedback about the operation's success or failure.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tech stack

Reze is built with modern, production-ready technologies:

- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python 3.12+, SQLAlchemy (async)
- **AI**: PydanticAI framework with GLM 4.7 from z.ai (OpenAI-compatible)
- **Knowledge base**: Memvid SDK for semantic search and RAG
- **Database**: SQLite with aiosqlite for development, PostgreSQL ready for production
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with marked.js for markdown rendering

<Note>
Reze uses an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint, making it easy to swap out the AI model if needed.

## Quick example

Here's how simple it is to send an email with Reze:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Send an email to john@example.com welcoming him to our platform",
    "username": "user1"
  }'
```

```python Python
import httpx
import json

url = "http://localhost:8000/api/chat/message"
data = {
    "message": "Send an email to john@example.com welcoming him to our platform",
    "username": "user1"
}

with httpx.stream("POST", url, json=data) as response:
    for line in response.iter_lines():
        if line.startswith("data: "):
            chunk = json.loads(line[6:])
            print(chunk["text"], end="")
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/chat/message', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    message: 'Send an email to john@example.com welcoming him to our platform',
    username: 'user1'
  })
});

const reader = response.body.getReader();
const decoder = new TextDecoder();

while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();
  if (done) break;
  console.log(decoder.decode(value));
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Reze will ask clarifying questions (subject, email content) and then send the email automatically.
