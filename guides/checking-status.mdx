description: Check email delivery status through Reze AI
---

After sending an email, you can check its delivery status to confirm it reached the recipient. Reze AI makes this simple through natural conversation.

## How it works

Reze uses the `get_email_status` tool to query the Resend.com API for email delivery information. The agent will:

1. Accept the email ID (from previous send or provided by you)
2. Query the Resend API for current status
3. Return human-readable status with explanation
4. Suggest next steps based on status

## Status types

Resend.com provides these email statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `queued` | Email is queued and will be sent shortly |
| `sent` | Email has been sent to the recipient's mail server |
| `delivered` | Email has been successfully delivered to the recipient |
| `bounced` | Email bounced - recipient's mail server rejected it |
| `complained` | Recipient marked the email as spam |

## Checking via chat

### After sending an email

When Reze sends an email, it offers to check the status:

```
Reze: "✓ Email sent successfully! Email ID: em_abc123xyz. 
       It should be delivered shortly. Would you like me to 
       check its delivery status?"

You: "Yes, check the status"

Reze: "Email em_abc123xyz status: SENT
       - Created: 2026-02-28T10:30:00Z
       - Last event: sent
       The email has been sent to the recipient's mail server."
```

### With a specific email ID

You can check any email ID directly:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Check the status of email em_xyz789abc",
    "conversation_id": "your-conversation-id"
  }'
```

Response:

```
Email em_xyz789abc status: DELIVERED
- Created: 2026-02-28T09:15:00Z
- Last event: delivered
✓ The email has been successfully delivered to the recipient.
```

## Understanding the tool

The `get_email_status` tool in `src/tools/resend.py`:

```python src/tools/resend.py
async def get_email_status(ctx: RunContext, data: GetEmailStatusRequest) -> str:
    """Get the delivery status of a sent email.

    ALWAYS CALL THIS TOOL when user asks about email status, 
    even if they provide the email_id directly.

    The email_id can come from:
    - User provides it directly (most common)
    - From a previous send_email operation in this conversation
    - From conversation context/memory

    REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
    - email_id: The unique email ID from Resend
    """
    try:
        result = await resend_service.get_email_status(data.email_id)

        response = f"Email {data.email_id} status: {result.status.upper()}\n"
        response += f"- Created: {result.created_at}\n"

        if result.last_event:
            response += f"- Last event: {result.last_event}\n"

        if result.status == "queued":
            response += "The email is queued and will be sent shortly."
        elif result.status == "sent":
            response += "The email has been sent to the recipient's mail server."
        elif result.status == "delivered":
            response += "✓ The email has been successfully delivered to the recipient."
        elif result.status == "bounced":
            response += "✗ The email bounced. The recipient's mail server rejected it. Check the email address."
        elif result.status == "complained":
            response += "⚠ The recipient marked the email as spam."
        else:
            response += f"The email status is: {result.status}"

        return response
    except Exception as e:
        return (
            f"✗ Failed to retrieve email status: {str(e)}. Please verify the email ID."
        )
```

</CodeGroup>

## Service implementation

The underlying service (`src/services/resend.py`) queries the Resend API:

```python src/services/resend.py
async def get_email_status(self, email_id: str) -> EmailResponse:
    logger.info(f"Fetching status for email: {email_id}")

    response = await self.client.get(f"{self.base_url}/emails/{email_id}")
    response.raise_for_status()

    result = response.json()
    status = result.get("status") or result.get("last_event", "unknown")
    logger.info(f"Email status retrieved: {status}")

    return EmailResponse(
        id=result.get("id") or email_id,
        status=status,
        created_at=result.get("created_at") or None,
        updated_at=result.get("updated_at") or None,
        last_event=result.get("last_event") or None,
        from_email=result.get("from") or None,
        to=result.get("to") or [],
        subject=result.get("subject") or None,
    )
```

## Response model

The `EmailResponse` model from `src/models/resend.py`:

```python src/models/resend.py
class EmailResponse(BaseModel):
    id: str = Field(..., description="Email ID")
    status: str = Field(default="unknown", description="Email status")
    created_at: str | None = Field(None, description="Creation timestamp")
    updated_at: str | None = Field(None, description="Last update timestamp")
    last_event: str | None = Field(None, description="Last delivery event")
    from_email: str | None = Field(None, alias="from", description="Sender email")
    to: list[str] | None = Field(None, description="Recipient emails")
    subject: str | None = Field(None, description="Email subject")
```

    - Last event: delivered
    ✓ The email has been successfully delivered to the recipient.
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Error handling

If the email ID is invalid or not found:

```
Reze: "✗ Failed to retrieve email status: Email not found. 
       Please verify the email ID."
```

<Warning>
  Email IDs are case-sensitive. Make sure to copy them exactly as returned by the send operation.
</Warning>

## Common patterns

You can ask Reze in natural language:

- "Check the status of email em_abc123"
- "What's the status of the last email I sent?"
- "Did the email to john@example.com get delivered?"
- "Check email status em_xyz789"
- "Has my email been delivered?"

Reze will understand the intent and call the appropriate tool.
